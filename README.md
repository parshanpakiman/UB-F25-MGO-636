## 🧭 Course Overview and Objectives

This course provides an analytical and managerial foundation for understanding and improving supply chain performance. A supply chain is a complex system involving multiple businesses, including suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, logistics providers, and retailers, working together to deliver products and services to end consumers. The course examines how supply networks are designed, managed, and coordinated to align with strategic business objectives.

Modern supply chains must adapt to globalization, digital transformation, and increasing customer expectations. We explore how advances in information technology and analytics have enabled greater efficiency and responsiveness, while also introducing new challenges related to coordination.

The course emphasizes both conceptual understanding and practical skills. Students will apply prescriptive analytics and modeling techniques to real-world supply chain problems using tools such as Excel Solver. Case studies, simulations, and group projects are used to build critical thinking, collaboration, and communication skills.

## 📚 Textbook 

- The required textbook is: *Supply Chain Management: Strategy, Planning, and Operations* (7th Edition) by Sunil Chopra (ISBN: 978-0134731889)  
- [Amazon](https://a.co/d/duJPt5g) offers multiple editions and rental options, including a paperback version which can be cheaper. You are encouraged to choose the most affordable version that covers the required content. 

**Cases and Games:**
- Required and optional case materials can be purchased at Harvard Business Publishing. Cost: $4.95 (essential) + $10 (optional materials): [https://hbsp.harvard.edu/coursepacks/1323155](https://hbsp.harvard.edu/coursepacks/1323155)
- If you do not already have a Harvard Business Publishing account, please register for a free one.
- You will participate in the eBeer Simulation game during the semester. Access instructions and play guidelines will be provided in class.

## 📘 Prerequisite or Co-requisite
None. However, the course has a significant quantitative component, including algebraic manipulations, basic calculus and probability (e.g., derivatives, simple distributions, independence), and data analysis (primarily in Excel). Familiarity with these concepts will be helpful. We will also formulate and solve optimization problems to apply the concepts learned in class. While a background in optimization is beneficial, all essential concepts will be introduced as the course progresses.

## 💻 Course Technology

### UBLearns
- The primary platform for this course is [UBLearns](http://ublearns.buffalo.edu/), which will serve as the central hub for course content, announcements, and grading.  
- Please familiarize yourself with UBLearns. You can explore its features and guides at [UBLearns Student Guide](https://www.buffalo.edu/lms/guides-students.html#title_0_copy:~:text=Quick%20Start%20Videos-,Available%20Guides,-Basics%20of%20UB)

### Zoom
- I will hold office hours both in person and online. If you prefer to attend online or schedule a virtual meeting with me, we will use Zoom. 
- Please log into your [UB Zoom](https://www.buffalo.edu/ubit/services/zoom.html) account before joining. You can access my scheduled Zoom meeting at https://buffalo.zoom.us/my/pakiman.office.hours.


### Generative AI
Generative AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) can support your learning, but they must be used **ethically and responsibly**. 

✅ **Permitted Uses**  
- Clarifying course concepts or terminology.  
- Brainstorming ideas, examples, or alternative approaches.  
- Practicing with additional problems or quizzes generated by AI.  
- Improving clarity, grammar, or formatting of your own writing.  

🚫 **Not Permitted**  
- Using AI to complete homework, quizzes, or exams.  
- Submitting any AI output as your own original work.  
- Using AI to generate code, formulas, or problem solutions you do not fully understand.  

⚠️ **Required Practice**  
- **Attempt first:** Always create your own draft or solution before using AI.  
- **Ask specifically:** Use AI to answer targeted questions or explain concepts, not to “do the work.”  
- **Acknowledge use:** Whenever you use an AI tool, include a brief *AI Use Statement* in your submission.  
  For example:  
  > I used ChatGPT to clarify the formula of return on equity.  
- **Verification:** The instructor and student assistant may use AI-detection tools to help determine whether submitted work is AI-generated or written by the student. Misrepresenting AI-generated work as your own is considered academic fraud. Read more at the [UB Academic Integrity – Artificial Intelligence](https://www.buffalo.edu/academic-integrity/about/artificial-intelligence.html) page.

## Appendix: Guidelines for Final Project

The final project is a **group assignment** that can take one of two formats:  
  1. **Case Study:** Analyze an existing supply chain process and propose improvements. A case study may also identify opportunities for new business models.  
  2. **White Paper:** Examine a supply chain practice in industry, describing its risks, benefits, best practices, and industry examples.

**Five Key Steps:**

1. **Form Your Team** – Create **groups of three** by the end of **Week 2**.  
2. **Choose a Topic** – Consult with me early to confirm your project scope. By the end of **Week 4**, your topic should be finalized so you can focus on research and analysis.  
3. **Submit Proposal** – A one-page (double-spaced, font size 11) project proposal must be submitted on **UBLearns** by **Week 8**.  
4. **Present Your Work** – In our final class session (**Monday, December 8, 2025**) during **Week 16**, each group will have approximately **10 minutes** to present their findings and respond to Q&As.  
5. **Submit Final Report** – Prepare a written executive report that identifies opportunities and recommends actionable improvements based on the chosen supply chain concepts. The report should be maximum of 10 pages (double-spaced, font size 11). Include figures and exhibits in an appendix if needed.

**Potential Topics:**
- Use of AI in supply chain contracting, forecasting, or optimization   
- Green or sustainable supply chain management (e.g., recycling, re-manufacturing, returns)  
- Service supply chain management (e.g., service outsourcing and management issues, healthcare, etc.)  
- Supply chain for product safety (e.g., initiatives to ensure product safety)   
- Supply chain management for disaster relief
