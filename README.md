- **Class Participation (5%):** I expect all enrolled students to attend and participate in class. Your class participation grade is based upon your attendance and contribution to in-class discussion. I expect all students to have read the chapters and cases before class, to understand their group's answers to all questions, and to be prepared to discuss those responses. You are expected to be an active participant throughout the class and to contribute to the quality of the discussion. Please note that the quality, rather than the frequency, of your interventions in class is the key criterion for effective class contribution.

- **Quizzes (40%)** 
  - Each quiz consists of short conceptual multiple choice and true/false questions. They are designed to encourage review of all concepts covered in class.
  - 📌 **Quiz 1** covers topics through Part III: Managing Inventory (up to 03/06)  
  - 📌 **Quiz 2** covers Part IV: Transportation Networks through the final lecture (04/24)
  - ⚠️ **Make-up quizzes** will only be granted for documented medical emergencies or unavoidable circumstances.


- **Assignments & Cases (30%)**
  - 7 assignments and 1 case
  - Some are textbook-based, others are case analyses  
  - Assignments may require spreadsheet tools like **Excel Solver**  
  - Work in **groups of 3–4** (form groups by ??/??)  
  - ❌ No credit for late submissions
  - Cases are found in the textbook or purchased (e.g., 1 HBS case). I will upload all questions for non-case assignments.

- **Group Project (20%):** For group and case assignments you will work in a group of 4-5 members. Groups will be self-selected and indicated on the submissions. You may not work alone on group assignments. You may only put your name on the group write-up if you contributed. Submit ONE document per group containing the assignments due as indicated on Canvas. We will ask you to evaluate the contributions of other group members at the end of the course (which will count toward your Class Participation score). I will allow groups to be formed across sections, but due to this allowance, all group assignments will be due
before the earliest class session of the week, i.e., 8:30am on Tuesday.
- **Project Report (15%):**  The case reports are graded for both content and presentation. A good report should clearly and succinctly state the recommendations up front and the remaining content should present clear supporting rationales for the recommendation in terms of the desirable and undesirable consequences of adopting it. Some common problems in preparing reports result from inadequate analysis. Analysis for a report is a time consuming and
intellectually challenging task. Each case has a set of prompts which are a guide to help you with the analysis; however, you should not limit your analysis to narrowly answering these questions. The objective is to evaluate a complete range of alternatives and anticipate and discuss the full consequences of your
recommendation. A good report is not a chronology of analysis, but a clearly articulated statement of recommendation and
support. If there are options under consideration in the case that are rejected by you, a clear rationale for your
decision should be provided. Facts stated in the case need not be restated unless used to make a point. I will
assume that the most important issues are raised in the report and that all else is less important to the writer.
Both desirable and undesirable consequences should be factually stated and supported. In the overall
evaluation of the report the discussion of all consequences of the recommendation is of the greatest
importance.
  - The course will culminate with a final project that your group will conduct on a Supply Chain topic of your choosing. Assignment details and guidelines are included in this syllabus, and also with the assignment posting on Canvas. The due dates are Week 5 for initial project proposals, and Week 10 (exam week) for final project submissions.

- **Presentation (5%)**
  - Participation includes contributing in lectures, asking questions, sharing news, and being engaged. Points may be deducted for:
  - Repeated absences or tardiness  
  - Disruptive behavior  
  - Lack of attentiveness (e.g., browsing the web during class)

## 🧭 Course Overview and Objectives

This course provides an analytical and managerial foundation for understanding and improving supply chain performance. A supply chain is a complex system involving multiple businesses—suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, logistics providers, and retailers—working together to deliver products and services to end consumers. The course examines how supply networks are designed, managed, and coordinated to align with strategic business objectives.

Modern supply chains must adapt to globalization, digital transformation, and increasing customer expectations. We explore how advances in information technology and analytics have enabled greater efficiency and responsiveness, while also introducing new challenges related to coordination, data security, and reliability.

The course is organized into three main modules:  
- **Supply Chain Framework and Design:** We introduce key concepts and metrics that define supply chain performance, discuss drivers of supply chain structure, and explore how different network configurations are better suited to various environments, cost structures, and customer needs.
- **Supply Chain Planning and Coordination:** We analyze the diverse incentives of stakeholders across the supply chain and the inefficiencies that may arise from misalignment. The course presents coordination mechanisms and strategies for creating mutually beneficial outcomes.
- **Inventory Management and Risk Mitigation:** We study the role of inventory in buffering against supply and demand uncertainty, managing economies of scale, and improving responsiveness. Emphasis is placed on cost trade-offs and tactical levers that enhance profitability and efficiency.

The course emphasizes both conceptual understanding and practical skills. Students will apply prescriptive analytics and modeling techniques to real-world supply chain problems using tools such as Excel Solver. Case studies, simulations, and group projects are used to build critical thinking, collaboration, and communication skills.
